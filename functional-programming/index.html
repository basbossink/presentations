       <h1>Functional Programming presentation</h1>
       <p>These github pages are the <em>binary</em> counterpart of 
       <a href="http://github.com/basbossink/presentations/tree/master/functional-programming/">these
           sources</a> of the material you find here. The slides are in <a href="http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy/#(1)">Slidy</a>
       format so I thought it would be nice to host them <a href="slides.html">here</a>, together with the <a href="notes.pdf">notes</a>.
       Slidy is said to work cross-browser and is operated like Powerpoint. A help page is available, to view press <em>h</em> .</p>
